- Mid-Value (32% revenue): Create upgrade paths through personalized promotions, with potential $66.6M → $135.4M revenue opportunity
- Low-Value (2% revenue): Design re-engagement campaigns and price-sensitive promotions to increase purchase frequency

📊 **Key Findings:**  
- Customer revenue is declining, older cohorts (2016-2018) spent ~$2,800+, while 2024 cohort spending dropped to ~$1,970.  
- Revenue and customers peaked in 2022-2023, but both are now trending downward in 2024.  
- High volatility in revenue and customer count, with sharp drops in 2020 and 2024, signaling retention challenges.  

💡 **Business Insights:**  
- Boost retention & re-engagement by targeting recent cohorts (2022-2024) with personalized offers to prevent churn.  
- Stabilize revenue fluctuations and introduce loyalty programs or subscriptions to ensure consistent spending.  
- Investigate cohort differences by applying successful strategies from high-spending cohorts (2016-2018) to newer ones.

### 3. Customer Retention
🖥️ Query: [3_retention_analysis.sql](3_retention_analysis.sql)

- Identified customers at risk of churning
- Analyzed last purchase patterns
- Calculated customer-specific metrics

**📈 Visualization:**

![7 3_customer_churn_cohort_year](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fea5fa22-66c6-4bcd-a04e-e976b980047b)


📊 **Key Findings:**  
- Cohort churn stabilizes at ~90% after 2-3 years, indicating a predictable long-term retention pattern.  
- Retention rates are consistently low (8-10%) across all cohorts, suggesting retention issues are systemic rather than specific to certain years.  
- Newer cohorts (2022-2023) show similar churn trajectories, signaling that without intervention, future cohorts will follow the same pattern.  

💡 **Business Insights:**  
- Strengthen early engagement strategies to target the first 1-2 years with onboarding incentives, loyalty rewards, and personalized offers to improve long-term retention.  
- Re-engage high-value churned customers by focusing on targeted win-back campaigns rather than broad retention efforts, as reactivating valuable users may yield higher ROI.  
- Predict & preempt churn risk and use customer-specific warning indicators to proactively intervene with at-risk users before they lapse.
